The goal of rdan is to provide a simple scheme for saving results into an RDA
file that acts like a notebook.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdan from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dankelley/rdan")
```

## Example

This shows how to store a number (with a name that is not valid for R) and
something quite a lot more fun -- 60 years before this package was created!

```{r example}
library(rdan)
# State name of RDA-notebook file (will be created if missing)
useRDA("sample.rda")
# Save a simple number
storeRDA("2pi", 2 * pi, "circle perimeter divided by radius")
retrieveRDA("2pi")
# Save a date
storeRDA("Beatlemania", as.Date("1964-02-09"), "Beatles perform on Ed Sullivan Show")
retrieveRDA("Beatlemania")
# Find names of all entries
listRDA()
# Remove notebook
file.remove("sample.rda")
```
