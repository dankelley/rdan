[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/dankelley/rdan/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dankelley/rdan/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)

The goal of rdan is to provide a simple scheme for saving results into an RDA
file that acts like a notebook.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdan from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dankelley/rdan")
```

## Example

Here is how we might store a number for use later.

```{r example}
library(rdan)
useRDA("sample.rda")
storeRDA("2pi", 2 * pi, "circle perimeter divided by radius")
retrieveRDA("2pi")
file.remove("sample.rda") # we don't need to store this!
```
